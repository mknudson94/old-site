				<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p id="intro">My name is Michael Knudson. I'm a Computer Engineering sophomore at Georgia Tech. I know a lot of software engineers who got started in programming when they were little kids, in a class at school or with a parent. I am not one of those people - I didn't write my first line of code till I was almost 20! It was in a college class: Intro to Programming in C++. I had no idea what I was doing (obviously) but seeing that "Hello world!" on the command line was one of the most exciting things I had done yet in my college career. The rest is history. I changed my major from mechanical engineering to computer engineering and just immersed myself in all things software. It's been two years and I'm at Georgia Tech, married to a front-end engineer, and working on my first side project: my personal website. Thanks for visiting!</p>

				<h3>The 23 year-old sophomore</h3>
					<p>Being a 23 year-old sophomore is definitely not normal. I get that. However, my post-high school experience has been full of opportunities and challenges, and I wouldn't change a thing.<br /><br />First- right after high school, my best friend and I decided to take some time off and hike the appalachian trail. For those who don't know, the Appalachian Trail is a footpath that stretches from Mt Katahdin, Maine to Springer Mountain, Georgia. While he ended up hiking it in its entirety, I only made it halfway, from Maine to Virginia. Even so, it delayed my college entry by a semester.<br /><br />Then- after my first semester at BYU-Idaho, I set off to serve a two-year, full time mission for my church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. You can read more about that in another post. That was another two years delaying my college graduation.<br /><br />Finally, after I returned from service as a missionary, I re-entered BYU-Idaho, completed one semester, and decided to take more time off while I contemplated what I really wanted in a career. I signed up with Americorps, and they paired me with Habitat for Humanity NYC. In the year I was there I learned how to work hard and be a leader.</p>

				<h3>A missionary story</h3>
					<p>After my first semester of college, I served a two-year, full-time volunteer mission for the LDS Church in Ogden, Utah, working specifically with Spanish-speaking congregations. After twenty-one months I met Austin, a new missionary who was also assigned to Spanish-speaking congregations. At this point I had been a group leader over dozens of missionaries and a trainer for two, but there was only one Austin.<br /><br />Despite serving with a disengaged and unmotivated trainer, Austin was bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, and eager to learn. I was assigned to lead and help Austin, his trainer, and other missionaries, and I immediately recognized that Austin needed extra help.<br /><br />Austin was not gifted with languages and was not confident that he ever would be. I worked with him weekly for the last three months of my mission, showing him by example how to be an effective missionary, involving him and encouraging him to take the lead in planning and teaching. Between teaching appointments in Spanish, we continued language training. Once I drove while he navigated in Spanish. It was good practice, even if we missed a few turns. Over those three months, I watched him grow in confidence and ability.<br /><br />I taught Austin how to be a missionary—to find people interested in learning about Jesus Christ, to teach religious lessons, and to coordinate with local congregations—all in Spanish. The foundation that we built at the beginning of his mission enabled him to succeed throughout the remainder of his two years of service.</p>
